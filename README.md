# sports-scraping
Various web scraping applications to collect data from current sports standings. 

There is a surprising lack of graphics or data on how a season progresses. Everybody reports on the teams who make the playoffs (or who just miss it), but what if a team does really well in the first half of the season? How did the standings shift throughout the season to give us the playoff teams?

Eventually hope to graph some of this data over time
